Instructions:

Speak 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 to change chess pieces.

Speak Up, Down, Left or Right to move chess pieces.

Description:

Out of the ml5.js resources, I thought that sound classifier was the
coolest, but instead of just printing out what was heard by the sound recognizer, I wanted to do
something with that input. 

So I decided to use a chess board in order to utilize the spoken
inputs. 

Saying the numbers would change the chess piece, while saying directions would move the
pieces. 

I first started with a double for loop to create the chess board and alternate the colors
of the chess board.

Then, I added the number changing. After, I added the movement, and also
added some checking so that the pieces stay within the board. 

Finally, I added some sfx to make it feel a little better.

One thing that I didn't do that would have been cool was to make it move
like the pieces actually do. For example, for a bishop saying "up" followed by "right" moving it
like how a bishop actually would, or even saying how many spaces, but it would take a lot
more time than I currently have to spare to do so many different choices.
